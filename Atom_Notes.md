## List of tips for using Atom

I'd encourage anyone that has a tip to contribute to this list. If you do add something, pull request the addition back into the main repos. Also, add your initials to the end of your tip.  

* CTRL-D on a selection, and keep repeating to select all occurrences of selected text. Very useful if you want to change a variable/function name. (TCS)

* CTRL-Left Mouse click. This creates multiple cursors. Then, whatever your type (or delete) will be applied at each courser. (TCS)

* Install package "Sublime Style Column Selection" - then, when holding down the alt-key, you can do block selection. Try it out -- I often use this to add #'s to the start of blocks of code. (TCS)

* Install Atom package Atom-Beautify - CDM-ALT-b will beautify your code. (TCS)

* Install Atom package PlatformIO IDE Terminal - CTRL-\` will open a terminal just below your code.  NOTE: This package often breaks with updates to Atom. So, it may not work with the version you have. It's a shame that this isn't more stable, as it's a very useful feature when it works. FOR MAC USERS: I'm not sure if PlatformIO IDE Terminal works on MacOS, but there are definitely Atom packages that do this in MacOS - you'll just need to search for one.
