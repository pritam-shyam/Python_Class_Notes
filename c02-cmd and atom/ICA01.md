# ICA01 - Cmd Basics

In this assignment, you will open a bash terminal in a personal directory (wherever you will be keeping your MIS407 materials). Keep this terminal open for the entire session. Once complete, you will cut and paste the text from this session and store in in a file called ICA01.txt. You will then submit this file to blackboard.

I will guide you through this process. Keep a copy of your ICA01.txt file for future reference. This exercise will cover most of the commands you'll need to "get around" in a command shell.

1. Display the current directory you are in
1. Create a new directory called test_folder
1. list all content in the current directory
1. Change directory into test_folder
1. Using the echo command, create a file called test.py that contains the python command print('Hello my name is Slim Shady') (be sure to insert your real name instead of Slim Shady.
1. Display the contents of the test.py to the console.
1. Run the test.py
1. Create a copy of the test.py file, call it test.py.BAK in the directory above your current directory.
1. Delete the test.py file.
1. Move up one directory (back into your original directory)
1. Display the current directory your are in
1. Remove the test_folder directory.
1. list the contents of the current direct to verify that you deleted the folder.
