# Git Experimental Branch

When managing your code, you should keep a "clean" master branch. Your master branch should be your released code. A common workflow is to create a working branch, and once any changes made are fully tested, merged back into the master branch.


By default, every repo is initialized with one branch, the "master" branch.

We can get a list of our branches and which is our current branch by using the branch command.
```
git branch
```

Let's create a new branch called experiment.
```
git branch experiment
git branch list
git branch
```

Though we created this branch, we are still in the master branch. Therefore, we must switch to our new experimental branch by "checking it out".
```
git checkout experiment
git branch
```

Now, we can experiment with our code without fear of loosing our working code in the master branch.

```
echo "here is some experimental stuff" >> experimental.txt
ls
git status
git add experimental.txt
git status
git commit -m "some experimental changes"
git status
```

The commit we just made is only to the experimental branch. Just to reassure us, we can checkout the master and notice that the master does not contain these changes.

```
git checkout master
git branch
ls
```

Now, let's go back into the experiment branch and finalize our changes.

```
git checkout experiment
echo "pretty sure this works OK" >> newstuff.txt
git status
rm experimental.txt
git status
git add .
git status
git commit -m "new release"
```

Since have our experimental code fully tested, we can now merge this back into our master branch.

```
git branch
git checkout master
git branch
git merge experiment
git status
ls
```

Now, we can clean up our experiment by deleting the experiment branch.

```
git branch
git branch -d experiment
git branch
```
