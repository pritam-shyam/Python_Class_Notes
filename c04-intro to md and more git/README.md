# w02c05 - Git, GitHub, Markdown (MD), and quick intro to Atom

In this class we continue our discussion of the basics of local repository management. We will also quickly introduce Atom.

We review three key workflows/tasks:

2. Rolling back changes.
3. Managing experimental/test changes to your released code.

By end of class you should know how to:

1. Initialize a repo, add files to staging area, and commit files to your repository.
2. Reset your repository to a previous commit point (only use this as a last resort -- proper branch management should help you avoid needing to do this)
3. List all branches, create a branch, know which branch you are one, and switch between branches.
