# Example workflow using Atom with Git

* Create a new local repo.
* Using explorer, right click within repo folder and open Atom
* Atom will load, and will have the local file tree displayed on the right.
* Create a file, call it test.txt
* Add some test txt
    * "This is some test text"
* Save and commit these changes
* Notice how Atom is responding - highlighting files that have changed and indicating the current live branch.
* Create a new branch called dev
* Add more text to test.txt
    * "More text"
* Again, take note of how Atom is responding (you'll need to give Atom focus for it to re-read the latest Git conditions)
* Let's say we're happy with our changes to test.txt
    * merge changes to master
* Again, take note of how Atom is responding to help you keep track of your code.
