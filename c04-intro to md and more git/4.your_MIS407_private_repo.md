# Your MIS407 Private Repo

You will submit individual assignments using Git. As mentioned previously, each MIS407 student will have access to a private GitHub repo. I've created one for each of you. You should now see this repo as MIS407-cid10xx.

Let's and add to this repo.

## Clone your MIS407-cid10xx repo to your local drive.

NOTE: if you've done this already, you can switch to your local repo that you've already created -- OR, you can create another copy and work from a new directory.

Change to your MIS407 directory and load a command prompt (I'd recommend using Git Bash).

Using a web-browser, login to your GitHub account (the one you would have sent me via email). Select the clone button, and copy the URL to your repo.

Using your local command prompt, clone your repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/MIS407-smith/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

## Add files to your local repo

Add a file HelloWorld.txt to your local repo's root directory.

```
echo "Hello world!" >> HelloWorld.txt
```

Now "push" this content up to your GitHub server

```
git add .
git commit -m "Add HelloWorld.txt"
git push origin master
```

To verify, go to your GitHub repo web-page and confirm that the HelloWorld.txt file is now loaded.
