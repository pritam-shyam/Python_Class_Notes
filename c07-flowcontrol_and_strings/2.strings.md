# w03c08-2 Strings

Strings are simply data structures that hold a sequence of characters.

Strings are a immutable type in Python (more about mutable and immutable later)

We create a string, like any variable in Python, by simply assigning it.

```
s = "Hello World"
```

And we can "slice" a string anyway we'd like:

```
print(s[:2])
print(s[3:])
print(s[2:5])
print(s[2:6:2])
```

We can find a strings length

```
len(s)
```

And, we have a number of other useful functions:

```
s.count("e")
s.find("H")
s.index("World")
```

For instance, we could count the number of "e"'s or the number of spaces'

```
s.count("e")
s.count(" ")
```

We may also want to split up a string based on the spaces found
```
s.split(' ')
```

We can also replace srings found within the string

```
s.replace("Hello", "Goodbye cruel")
```

And, there a number of other useful supporting functions
```
s.upper()
s.lower()
s.title()
s.capitalize()
s.swapcase()
```

And, we can strip off leading and trailing characters (which space)

```
s = "     Hello World      \n"
strip(s)
lstrip(s)
rstrip(s)
```

As we expect, we concatenate as well
```
s = "Hello " + "World"
s = "Hello " + "World" + "!"
```

```
s = "Hello World"

s.isalnum()
s.isalpha()
s.isdigit()
s.istitle()
s.isupper()
s.islower()
s.isspace()
s.endswith('d')
s.startswith('H')
```

# An illustrative Example: Control flow and string slicing

The following program scrambles a persons first name by replacing all vowels with a random vowel.

Also, notice how this also preserves the case of any given character.


```python
import random

lvowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
uvowels =  ['A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']
vowels =  lvowels + uvowels

fname = input("Enter your first name: ")

new_name = ""
for i in range(len(fname)):
  if fname[i] not in vowels:
      new_name+=fname[i]
  else:
      if fname[i].isupper():
          new_name+=random.choice(uvowels)
      else:
          new_name+=random.choice(lvowels)

print(new_name)


```
